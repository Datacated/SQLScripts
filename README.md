This repo holds some quick scripts that I use on a regular basis

MergeAndSelectGenerator.sql 
If you use staging tables, merges, or are wanting to test code changes to make sure you know what values might be affected, this is a quick way to generate some code. Not too complicated, but a time saver.
  1. a merge statement (slow and painful but useful sometimes)
  2. a select statement
  3. an insert statement
  4. an update statement
  5. a comparison
